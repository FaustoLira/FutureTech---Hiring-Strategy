# Project: FutureTech - Hiring Strategy

## Introduction

This project aims to utilize advanced visualization and storytelling techniques to create a compelling analytical 
presentation on the recruitment processes employed by "FutureTech," a fictional data analytics consulting firm.

This project is the result of the final project for the Data Visualization and Storytelling course at NBCC, 
created in collaboration with Anslem Okeke.

### FutureTech

With over 15 years in the analytics consulting business, FutureTech is faced with the need to adapt to modern trends in inclusion, work flexibility, and a culture of continuous learning, among others. With regard to inclusion, the company has established five hiring programs: ABXL, ARC, EMA, REP, and QB. The goal is to begin balancing the different types of talent in the company. The company has set an initial target of 25% of vacancies exclusively for women and 40% of vacancies exclusively for the diversity group (ethnic women and men and non-ethnic women).
