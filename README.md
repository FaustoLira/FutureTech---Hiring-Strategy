# Project: FutureTech - Hiring Strategy

This project aims to utilize advanced visualization and storytelling techniques to create a compelling analytical presentation on the recruitment processes employed by "FutureTech," a fictional data analytics consulting firm.

## FutureTech

With over 15 years in the analytics consulting business, FutureTech is faced with the need to adapt to modern trends in inclusion, work flexibility, and a culture of continuous learning, among others. With regard to inclusion, the company has established five hiring programs: ABXL, ARC, EMA, REP, and QB. The goal is to begin balancing the different types of talent in the company. The company has set an initial target of 25% of vacancies exclusively for women and 40% of vacancies exclusively for the diversity group (ethnic women and men and non-ethnic women).

## Visualization Techniques

The visualizations were inspired by the Gestalt principles of visual perception described in [Knaflic, C. N. (2019)](https://www-oreilly-com.libproxy.nbcc.ca/library/view/storytelling-with-data/9781119002253/)
