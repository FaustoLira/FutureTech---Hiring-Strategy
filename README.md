# Project: FutureTech - Hiring Strategy

This project aims to apply advanced visualization and storytelling techniques to create an analytical presentation on the recruitment processes 
used at 'FutureTech', a fictional analytical consulting company.

## FutureTech

With more than 15 years in the analytics consultancy business, the company FutureTech faces the need to adapt to modern trends of inclusivity, 
work flexibility, continuous learning culture, among others. With respect to inclusivity, the company has established five hiring programs: 
ABXL, ARC, EMA, REP, and QB. The goal is to start balancing the different types of talent in the company. It establishes an initial target 
of 25% of vacancies for women and 40% of vacancies for the diversity group (ethnic female and male and non-ethnic female). 

The presentation can be found in the file "presentation.pdf" for static presentation or "presentation.gif" to see inserted animations.
The fully understand behind the techniques used in this projects can be seen in "standalone.pdf".
